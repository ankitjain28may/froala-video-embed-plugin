# froala-video-embed-plugin

This is a froala-wysiwyg-editor video embedding plugin, It embeds video directly on copy/paste or typing its link.

## Inspire From-

As plugin `Url` which convert text to URL as you type and another pluign `Video` which easily insert videos by URL or by embedded code.

## What it does ?

I have combined the features of both the plugin. So, This plugin easily convert text to URL and insert videos by URL or by embedded code.

So, We need not to insert the video through the button in the text editor, we can insert videos directly by copy/paste or by typing the text.

You need to insert the `url.min.js` as a plugin in your file and `video.min.css` too.

Everything will handle by it.

>Note- I am using video.css which was officially the css of `Video` plugin of froala for giving the styling.
